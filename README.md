# Sign-Language-Alphabet-Gesture-Recognition

 - Created a software system for real-time recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet gestures using computer vision, improving communication accessibility for the deaf community.
- Utilized LSTM training model with Mediapipe to detect keypoint coordinates from the onscreen hand skeleton, enabling accurate alphabet mapping functionality.
- Implemented a feature that displays the recognized ASL alphabet letter on the screen for both the signer and observer, enhancing visual communication experience.
